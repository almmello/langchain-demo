Spaceships are vehicles that can travel in outer space. They are used for exploration, research, transportation and colonization of other planets and moons. There are many types of spaceships, depending on their purpose, design and technology.
One of the most common types of spaceships is the rocket, which uses a chemical reaction to propel itself forward. Rockets can launch from Earth or from other celestial bodies, such as the Moon or Mars. Some rockets are reusable, meaning they can land back on Earth or another surface and be used again. Examples of reusable rockets are SpaceX's **Dragonfly** and **Starlight**.
Another type of spaceship is the spaceplane, which can fly in both air and space. Spaceplanes use wings to generate lift in the atmosphere and engines to accelerate in space. Spaceplanes can take off and land like airplanes, making them more convenient than rockets. Examples of spaceplanes are Virgin Galactic's **SpaceShipOne** and Boeing's **X-38A**.
A third type of spaceship is the space station, which is a large structure that orbits around a planet or moon. Space stations provide a permanent habitat for humans and robots in space, where they can conduct scientific experiments, grow food, repair satellites and dock other spaceships. Examples of space stations are the International Space Station (ISS) and China's **Tianhe**.
A fourth type of spaceship is the probe, which is a small device that travels to a specific destination in space. Probes carry instruments to collect data about their target, such as its surface features, atmosphere, magnetic field and gravity. Probes can also land on or orbit around their target, or fly by it at high speed. Examples of probes are NASA's **Curiosity** rover on Mars and **Jupiter Express** orbiter around Jupiter.
A fifth type of spaceship is the starship, which is a hypothetical vehicle that can travel faster than light (FTL). Starships use advanced technologies such as warp drives or wormholes to bend space-time and reach distant stars and galaxies in a short time. Starships could enable interstellar exploration and communication with alien civilizations. Examples of starships are USS Enterprise from Star Trek and Millennium Falcon from Star Wars.
