# Project Demo: Langchain Library

This repository contains a demo project that uses the Langchain library to create an AI-powered question-answering system. The project demonstrates how to leverage the capabilities of the library with a fun and engaging theme: astronauts, spaceships, and planets. However, the same approach can be applied to any type of data.

## Overview

The Langchain library is a powerful tool for building language models and creating AI-driven applications. This demo project aims to showcase the library's potential in a practical and engaging way. With the help of the Langchain library and contributions from the Langchain Discord community, including Harrison Chase, we have created an interactive question-answering system that covers a wide range of topics related to astronauts, spaceships, and planets.

You can learn more about the Langchain library by visiting their official documentation: [https://langchain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](https://langchain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

## Features

- Import and process data from various sources (text files, in this case)
- Create vector stores for efficient storage and retrieval of information
- Build question-answering systems for specific topics (planets, astronauts, spaceships)
- Initialize AI agents with the appropriate tools and settings
- Generate responses based on user queries

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
3. Set up an OpenAI API key and add it to your environment variables.
4. Run the provided code, which will initialize the AI agent and generate a response for the given prompt.

## Acknowledgements

We would like to extend our gratitude to the Langchain Discord community and Harrison Chase for their valuable contributions to this project. Their insights and expertise have been instrumental in bringing this demo to life.

## Future Plans

We intend to further develop and expand this demo, incorporating new features and exploring additional applications of the Langchain library. We welcome collaboration and feedback from the community to help us refine and improve the project.
